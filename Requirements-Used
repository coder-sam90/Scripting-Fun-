Here are the modules that we are using in python. 
- OS
- shutil
- Path/Pathlib

OS is generaly used to interact with your OS. 
shutil is shell utitlies. This is used for high level file and directory operations. 
Path and Pathlib are used with file system paths in a easier way.

pathlib = Your GPS (finds paths, tells you about locations)
shutil = Your moving truck (actually moves stuff around)
os = Your toolbox (general system tasks, though we used pathlib instead)
